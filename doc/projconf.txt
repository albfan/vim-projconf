*projconf*

Installation: Install with Vundle.

   Plugin 'albfan/vim-projconf'

Usage:

Set your projects path into g:ProjConf as a list, for example:

let g:ProjConf = [ "~/work/proj1" ]

In this case for all file match the pattern "~/work/proj1/*", the tag file
"~/work/proj1/tags" will be used.

You can also specify a tags file other than the default one or more tags
files for one directory by a list:

let g:ProjConf += [[ "~/work/proj2", "~/work/proj2/tags",
"~/work/common.tags" ]]

In this case for all files match the pattern "~/work/proj2/*", the tag files
"~/work/proj2/tags" and "~/work/common.tags" will be used.

If one of the items in the list begins with ":", it will be treated as a
command (other than tag file):

let g:ProjConf += [[ "~/work/proj3", "~/work/proj3/tags",
":set shiftwidth=4" ]]

In this case for all files match the pattern "~/work/proj3/*", the tag file
"~/work/proj3/tags" will be used, and "shiftwidth=4" will be set.

Please note that if you use "set" in the command, we will actually use
"setlocal" instead, to avoid polluting the whole vim environment.

You can add the above codes into your vimrc file
